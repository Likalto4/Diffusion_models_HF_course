# Model Card for a model trained based on the Unit 1 of the [Diffusion Models Class ðŸ§¨](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class), not using accelarate yet.

This model is a diffusion model for unconditional image generation of cute, adorable but small ðŸ¦‹.
The model was trained with 1000 images using the [DDPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) architecture. Images generated are of 64x64 pixel size.
The model was trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 64, using around 11 GB of GPU memory. 

## Usage

```python
from diffusers import DDPMPipeline

pipeline = DDPMPipeline.from_pretrained({hub_model_id})
image = pipeline().images[0]
image
```
